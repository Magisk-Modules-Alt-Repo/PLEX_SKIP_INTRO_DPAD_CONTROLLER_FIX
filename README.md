# Plex "Skip Intro" DPad Controller Fix

## Module Description:
Magisk module that maps key code 28 to "DPAD_ENTER" instead of "ENTER".  This allows for the DPad "OK" button to work properly, so that when you press the "OK" button, it actually presses the "Skip Intro" button.  This fixes a very annoying, and long ignored issue encountered when using a DPad controller inside PLEX on Android TV.  Without this module, when you press the "OK" button on a DPad Controller when the "Skip Intro" button appears in plex, it'll bring up player controls instead of actually skipping the intro.
